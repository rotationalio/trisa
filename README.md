# TRISA-RL

**Rotational Labs TRISA Service Implementation**

This is a Golang implementation of a TRISA server that handles incoming TRISA requests (no outgoing requests). Rotational Labs is not a VASP, therefore this implementation mostly serves as a sketch for how to quickly implement a TRISA server in Go and is also used as a testing backstop for Rotational Labs partners who would like to ensure their TRISA messages are being parsed correctly (though Rotational Labs recommends using the [rVASPs](https://trisa.dev/testnet/rvasps/) for this purpose).
